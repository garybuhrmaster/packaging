NOTE: The HDHomeRun DVR software requires configuration
before first use.

Installation provides an init script (hdhomerun_record)
and a system user/group hdhomerun to run the recorder
without privledges.

The file /etc/hdhomerun.conf must be configured to specify
the RecordPath, a directory where the logs and the recorded
content will be stored.  This directory must be created
in such a way as the hdhomerun user can write to it
(either owned by the hdhomerun user, or appropriate acls).

The recorder needs to be able to communicate with the
tuners on your network, and to be discoverable by your
clients.  If you are have a network firewall configured,
you will likely need to allow incoming traffic to the
port specified in /etc/hdhomerun.conf (defaults to
port 65001) and to allow the responses from the broadcast
packets used for tuner discovery.  If your logs show that
no tuners are discovered, or your clients find no recorders,
your firewall configuration is one of the first things to
review.

To start the recorder: service hdhomerun_record start
To stop the recorder: service hdhomerun_record stop
To automate startup: chkconfig hdhomerun_record on

Note that upgrading will not restart the service in
order to not interrupt any ongoing recordings or
playback, so after an upgrade one will need to restart
the service at a convenient time.
