Tools to build MythTV rpms

NOTE:  With the latest FFmpeg in master (targeted to be version 30) the EL7
       version of libvpx is too old.  The local definition of the centos
       repository includes a COPR reference that will support compilation.
       To install the EL7 RPMs, you will (likely) need to add that COPR
       (or some equivalent) to your system (`yum copr enable gtb/libvpx`),
       and with the latest master (targeted to be version 32) the EL7
       version of taglib is too old.  The local definition of the centos
       repository includes a COPR reference that will support compilation.
       To install the EL7 RPMs, you will (likely) need to add that COPR
       (or some equivalent) to your system (`yum copr enable gtb/taglib`).
